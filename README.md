# Linkuma Promo Codes and Latest Linkuma Backlink Deals for 2026

So you're hunting for a netlinking platform that won't drain your bank account but still delivers solid results? That's exactly the spot most SEO folks find themselves in. Look, I've been around the block with backlink platforms, and here's what I can tell you about Linkuma—it's become one of those rare finds where "budget-friendly" doesn't automatically translate to "questionable quality."

## Linkuma Introduction

Linkuma launched back in November 2022, which makes it relatively young in the netlinking game. But don't let that fool you. The French platform has already attracted over 12,000 clients, which tells you something about what they're doing right.

The whole operation started when a group of SEO experts looked at the backlink market and thought, "This is unnecessarily complicated and expensive." So they built something different—a platform that makes quality backlinks accessible to everyone, not just agencies with massive budgets.

What's their secret sauce? They own and maintain over 1,200 websites themselves. This means they control the quality from top to bottom, rather than acting as a middleman between you and random website owners. Their network spans 12 different niches, from cooking and health to tech and real estate.

The team behind Linkuma includes passionate SEO specialists who handle everything from site management to content strategy. They're not just selling links—they're actively involved in making sure those links actually help your rankings. And here's something refreshing: they offer free strategy consultations. No catch, no hidden upsell. They genuinely want to help you figure out the right approach.

One unique thing they do is support a charity organization every month through their "probono" initiative. It's a small touch, but it shows they're thinking beyond just business metrics.

## Linkuma Promo Codes

Let's talk about saving money, because who doesn't want that? As of January 2026, Linkuma runs promotional campaigns that can slash your costs significantly. Here's what's currently floating around:

**Active Promo Codes:**

- **BIENVENUE20** - Get 20% off your order
- **FIRST15** - Receive 15% discount plus a free SEO audit
- **NOUVEAU2025** - Score 25% off on discovery packages

Now, a word of caution: these codes come and go. The best way to stay on top of current promotions is to subscribe to their newsletter or follow them on social media. They occasionally drop exclusive deals to their email subscribers first.

**How to use these codes:**

1. Create your free Linkuma account
2. Browse through their catalog and select the sites that match your niche
3. During checkout, look for the promo code field
4. Enter your code and watch the price drop
5. Complete your purchase

The platform also runs special promotions during major marketing events—think Black Friday, Cyber Monday, or industry-specific SEO conferences. During these periods, discounts can hit up to 80% off regular prices.

Here's a pro tip: if you're planning a bigger campaign, you can stack the affiliate program benefits with promo codes. The affiliate program offers a 20% commission on the first order and 12% on subsequent orders. So if you're working with clients or planning multiple projects, this can add up to serious savings.

## Linkuma Promotional Activities

Linkuma structures their offerings into three main pricing tiers, each designed for different needs and budgets. Here's the complete breakdown:

| Package | Price | Article Length | Site Type | Key Features | Purchase Link |
|---------|-------|---------------|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| **Starter** | €7 | 300 words minimum | Generalist sites | Custom design sites, indexing guarantee or replacement | [Buy Now](https://app.linkuma.com/register?fpr=we3sv) |
| **Linkuma** | €10 | 450 words minimum | Themed sites | Visible site metrics, custom design, themed content, indexing guarantee | [Buy Now](https://app.linkuma.com/register?fpr=we3sv) |
| **Boost** | From €30 | 500 words minimum | Premium sites | High-quality metrics, visible stats, themed options, indexing guarantee | [Buy Now](https://app.linkuma.com/register?fpr=we3sv) |
| **Marketplace** | €70-€190 | 500+ words | Premium themed sites | Full domain visibility, advanced metrics, expert selection | [Buy Now](https://app.linkuma.com/register?fpr=we3sv) |

**What makes each tier different?**

The **Starter** package works well if you're testing the waters or working with a tight budget. You get backlinks on general-topic websites with solid fundamentals. The content is professionally written, and the sites are well-maintained.

The **Linkuma** package steps things up by giving you access to niche-specific sites. This matters because Google values topical relevance. A backlink from a cooking site to your recipe blog carries more weight than one from a random generalist site. Plus, you can see the metrics before purchasing, which helps you make informed decisions.

The **Boost** package is where things get interesting if you're serious about rankings. These are premium spots with strong metrics—we're talking Trust Flow, Citation Flow, and referring domain numbers that make SEO professionals do a double-take.

The **Marketplace** option, introduced in 2024, gives you complete transparency. You see the actual domain names before purchase, can analyze every metric in detail, and choose based on your exact requirements. This level of control is rare at these price points.

**Available Themes:**

Linkuma offers backlinks across 12 specialized categories:

- Animals & Pets
- Cooking & Food
- Business & Entrepreneurship
- Finance & Real Estate
- General Interest
- IT & Technology
- Home & Garden
- Fashion & Women's Lifestyle
- Health & Wellness
- Sports & Fitness
- Tourism & Travel
- Automotive & Vehicles

**Additional Features:**

What separates Linkuma from competitors isn't just the pricing—it's the extras:

- **Free Order Delegation**: Don't know how to build a netlinking strategy? Their SEO experts will handle the entire process for you. They'll analyze your site, select appropriate backlinks, and execute the campaign. No additional fees.

- **Spreadsheet Mode**: Planning a large-scale campaign? Import your data via spreadsheet and place bulk orders. This saves hours of manual work.

- **Indexing Guarantee**: If your backlink isn't indexed within 21 days, they replace it for free. And they keep the original article live. This is huge because unindexed backlinks are essentially worthless.

- **Free SEO Audit Tool**: Before you order, run their audit tool on your website. It analyzes your current SEO health and suggests optimizations. This alone can save you from wasting money on backlinks that won't help.

- **Project Tracking**: Create separate projects for different websites and track performance individually. The interface is clean and actually useful, not just dashboard clutter.

**Ordering Process:**

The platform offers three ordering methods:

1. **Simple Order**: Browse, select sites, customize your requirements, and checkout
2. **Bulk Order**: Upload a spreadsheet with your specifications for multiple orders
3. **Delegation**: Tell them your goals and budget, and they handle everything

Delivery is typically within 2-3 days. Fast turnaround is critical when you're managing client campaigns or time-sensitive SEO pushes.

## Linkuma Reviews

The platform holds a 4.7 out of 5 rating on Trustpilot from over 117 reviews. That's not inflated marketing speak—actual users are rating their experience highly.

**What users consistently praise:**

People keep mentioning the quality-to-price ratio. One user noted they were "on a tight budget" but found the backlinks surprisingly effective. The support team gets called out repeatedly—they're responsive, knowledgeable, and actually helpful rather than just copy-pasting canned responses.

The indexing speed impresses users. Many competitive platforms promise indexing but deliver slowly. Linkuma's links tend to get picked up by Google within days, not months.

**Common themes in positive reviews:**

"The platform is clear and easy to understand" comes up often. SEO tools have a reputation for being unnecessarily complex. Linkuma breaks that pattern.

"The affiliation system is fun" might sound weird, but their gamified affiliate program actually makes earning commissions engaging rather than feeling like a grind.

"Support is extremely responsive" appears in review after review. When you have a question or issue, getting quick answers matters more than fancy features.

**What professional SEO consultants say:**

Agency owners report using Linkuma successfully for client campaigns. They appreciate the ability to resell links with their own margin, and the transparency helps them justify the investment to clients.

Some users specifically tested Linkuma against other platforms. One reviewer mentioned running a test campaign using only Linkuma links and saw "spot on" performance.

**The few criticisms:**

To be balanced, some users note that while the Starter package offers good value, serious competitive niches need the Boost or Marketplace options. That's fair—€7 backlinks won't single-handedly rank you for "insurance" or "credit cards."

A handful mention wishing for even more niche options beyond the current 12 categories. The team has been expanding their network regularly, so this might change.

**Real user testimonial examples:**

One consultant shared: "Mohamed really listens to his customers. They offer real support that sometimes even goes beyond netlinking, and that's incredible."

Another noted: "Right now, it's THE best netlinking platform on the market. The links are of high quality and index quickly."

An agency owner said: "Top value for money, accessible and responsive team. I can only recommend Linkuma."

**Independent third-party assessments:**

SEO review sites have tested Linkuma's effectiveness. Multiple sources confirm that the backlinks successfully improve rankings, even for moderately competitive keywords. The combination of topical relevance, regular content updates on their sites, and reasonable pricing creates a compelling package.

**Bottom line:** Linkuma occupies an interesting position in the netlinking market. They're not trying to be the premium-priced elite option, and they're not racing to the bottom on quality to offer the absolute cheapest links. They've found a sweet spot where budget-conscious SEO professionals can get legitimate results without compromising standards.

The platform works particularly well for small businesses, freelance SEO consultants, and agencies managing multiple client campaigns. If you're just starting with link building or testing a new website's potential, the low entry price removes the risk.

That indexing guarantee matters more than it might seem at first. Bad backlinks don't just fail to help—they can actively hurt your rankings if they're on spammy, unindexed sites. Linkuma's replacement policy eliminates that worry.

The free consultation and delegation services transform what could be a transactional platform into more of a partnership. They're betting that if they help you succeed, you'll keep coming back. Based on their client numbers and reviews, that strategy seems to be working.

Is Linkuma perfect? No platform is. But for what it promises—affordable, quality backlinks with solid support—it delivers consistently. And in the often sketchy world of SEO services, that reliability is worth a lot.
